## Microservices Overview

NOTLI consists of five specialized microservices that work together to deliver notifications at massive scale. Each microservice's documentation contains more detailed diagrams illustrating its internal workings:

1. **Authentication Microservice**: Manages user onboarding, generates channel-specific API keys, and handles notification preferences
2. **Message Queue Processing Microservice**: Handles message ingestion, validation, idempotency, and initial processing
3. **Notification Prioritization Microservice**: Ensures critical messages are processed first with sophisticated prioritization algorithms
4. **Fan-Out Distribution and Delivery Microservice**: Handles templating, channel-specific delivery, and provider failover
5. **Analytics and Administration Microservice**: Provides real-time insights and administrative control

## Data Flow Through the System

1. **Client Integration**: External applications authenticate with channel-specific API keys and submit notifications via REST API
2. **Ingestion and Validation**: Notifications are validated, metadata is stored, and messages are placed in Kafka topics
3. **Prioritization**: Messages are categorized (transactional vs. promotional) and prioritized based on business rules
4. **Template Processing**: Content is rendered using the appropriate template engine based on the notification's template_id
5. **Delivery**: Notifications are routed to the appropriate delivery channel with intelligent provider selection
6. **Analytics**: Delivery events, user engagement, and system metrics are collected and processed in real-time
7. **Administration**: Admins manage the system through a comprehensive dashboard with powerful tools

## Microservice Details

### Microservice 1: Authentication

The Authentication Microservice provides user onboarding (signup/login), JWT-based session management, API key generation and management, API key validation for other services, rate limiting, and request proxying.

- **User Management**: Secure signup/login.
- **Session Management**: JWT access and refresh tokens.
- **API Key Management**: CRUD operations for API keys.
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory token bucket per API key or IP.
- **Request Proxying**: Securely forwards requests with valid API keys.
- **Modern Dashboard**: Basic HTML/JS/CSS interface for managing API keys and testing proxy.

#### Key Technologies:
- Go (Gin) (backend)
- HTML/JS/CSS (frontend)
- PostgreSQL (GORM) (user/key storage)
- JWT (`golang-jwt/jwt/v5`)
- Bcrypt (password hashing)
- In-Memory Rate Limiter (`golang.org/x/time/rate`)

### Microservice 2: Message Queue Processing

The Message Queue Processing Microservice handles the critical ingestion phase for notification requests:

- **High-Throughput API**: Accepts notification requests via REST.
- **API Key Validation**: Calls MS1 to validate `X-API-Key`.
- **Idempotency**: Checks for duplicate requests using PostgreSQL.
- **Kafka Producer**: Publishes validated messages to the `notifications` Kafka topic.
- **Message Types**: Differentiates between transactional and promotional types.

#### Key Technologies:
- Go (Gin) (API endpoint)
- Kafka (Producer using `segmentio/kafka-go`)
- PostgreSQL (`database/sql`, `lib/pq`) (idempotency tracking)

### Microservice 3: Notification Prioritization

The Notification Prioritization Microservice ensures critical messages are processed efficiently:

- **Kafka Consumer/Producer**: Consumes from `notifications`, produces to `prioritized_notifications`.
- **Prioritization Logic**: Applies internal rules based on message type, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforces limits using Redis state.
- **Background Processing**: Runs as a continuous Kafka stream processor.

#### Key Technologies:
- Go (background service, Gin for health check)
- Kafka (Consumer/Producer using `segmentio/kafka-go`)
- Redis (`go-redis/redis/v8`) (rate limiting state)

### Microservice 4: Fan-Out Distribution and Delivery

The Delivery Microservice handles the final delivery, starting with email:

- **Kafka Consumer**: Consumes from `prioritized_notifications`.
- **Templating Engine**: Renders email content using custom/local templates.
- **Email Delivery**: Sends emails via Resend API.
- **Status Logging & Retries**: Logs delivery attempts/status to PostgreSQL and handles retries.
- **Circuit Breakers**: (Potentially implemented, mentioned in description but not explicitly confirmed in `main.go`).

#### Key Technologies:
- Go (background service, Gin for health check/API)
- Kafka (Consumer using `segmentio/kafka-go`)
- Resend (`resend/resend-go/v2`) (email provider)
- PostgreSQL (`lib/pq`) (logging, retry state)
- Custom Go Template Engine

### Microservice 5: Analytics and Administration

The Analytics Microservice provides comprehensive visibility and control:

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Process millions of events per minute (Placeholder - technology not reviewed).
- **Multi-Channel Metrics**: Unified view across all notification channels.
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Comprehensive web interface for system management.
- **Custom Reporting**: Flexible analytics with drill-down capabilities.
- **Dead Letter Management**: Tools for handling failed notifications.

#### Key Technologies:
- Apache Flink (stream processing)
- Go (administration API)
- React with Tailwind CSS (dashboard)
- Elasticsearch (analytics storage)
- Redis (metric caching)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Scalability

NOTLI is designed for extreme scale at every level:

- **Stateless Components**: All services can scale horizontally
- **Kubernetes-Based Orchestration**: Dynamic scaling based on load
- **Optimized Data Flow**: Efficient message passing with minimal overhead
- **Adaptive Processing**: Different paths for transactional vs. promotional messages
- **Traffic Spike Handling**: Ability to handle 10x normal volume without degradation

### High Availability

System reliability is ensured through:

- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Services deployed across multiple availability zones
- **No Single Points of Failure**: Redundancy at every level
- **Graceful Degradation**: Prioritize critical functions during partial outages
